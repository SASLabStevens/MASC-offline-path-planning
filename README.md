# MASC For Landing Trajecotory Prediction and Optimal Landing Areas Selection

This repository contains MASC offline landing trajectory prediction and feasibility evaluation for backup landing areas, with support of Nonlinear guidance logic, UAV Guidance Model from MATLAB, and mathematic path discretization tool. The system takes in discretized reference trajectory to calculate the predicted landing path for evaluating the feasibility of the landing zone. This scheme run under the acceleration mode. The compile-time proves the less computation demanding. An online path planning and guidance demonstration of the system can be found here -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmX2kXaYxDslZy5klvJAoZgwgKunmYe_/view?usp=sharing

- Approachablility Evaluation for Landing Areas
- Low Fidelity Simulation with UAV Guidance Model
- Light weight offline path planning framework(Low computation demanded)

## Dependencies

- [MATALB R2021a](https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/previous_release_overview.html)
- [DSP System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/dsp-system.html)
- [UAV Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/uav.html)
- [Aerospace Blockset](https://www.mathworks.com/products/aerospace-blockset.html)


## Installation


#### Set up input data channel and output data channel in X-Plane

- Build a folder named UAV in document/example folder. Put the package under the new building folder named UAV. 

## Running MASC Examples
1.  Open model by running the command listed below.
   ```
   navigationModel = 'pathFollowing';
   open_system(navigationModel);
   ``` 
2.  Initiate the model parameters by running 
   ```
   plantDataDictionary = Simulink.data.dictionary.open('pathFollowingData.sldd');
   plantDataSet = getSection(plantDataDictionary,'Design Data');

   % Switch to high-fidelity model
   assignin(plantDataSet,'useHighFidelity',1);
   
   % Switch to low-fidelity model
   assignin(plantDataSet,'useHighFidelity',0);
   ``` 
3.  Set up the airport coordinates and engine malfunction position for generating the discretized reference trajectory 
   ```
   Run the Get_Discretized_Point program in the MATLAB terminal.
   ``` 
4.  Feed those discretized trajectory point to the model and then click the run button to start the simulink model first.   
   ```
   assignin(plantDataSet,'useHighFidelity',0);

   sim(navigationModel);
   ```
